# Sonidanner - Public Source Code
Sonidanner is a ROM Hack of Sonic the Hedgehog that tends to make different and basic linear level design, abilities, music and palette (Also cool stuff that nobody expect it to be in actual ROM Hack). This ROM Hack is actually lesson for making a ROM Hack with unique stuff like palette, music and the exclusive engine used is Purish Engine that Mildanner did make. People do not call it "Sonic 1 Under 500 successor" or else something bad will happen...

This ROM Hack has a goal to be exactly the same palette change (Simple tile change on Zones) and proving that the palette change from the ROM Hack is better than all of the generic palette change from ROM Hacks, also it takes such inspiration for that classic game and tends to follow all of existing artist colors.

Here are questions related to Purish and Sonidanner
## What in the world is "Purish Engine"?
Mildanner's personal ROM Hacking base that he calls it "engine" that has the additions he like.
## "Sonidanner" is it like SoniNeko?
No, there are no stuff related to SoniNeko since there's no people to help in code. I had to make it in individual and not reach the hacking community.
## Why Under 500 was a failure?
It used abandoned ASM68K branch (Stole assets from other ROM Hacks like Sonic 1 South Island Expedition and also got rejected to join SHC) and is also not possible to add Mega PCM 2, if you want to see the pre-installed Mega PCM 2 from the same disassembly. Check it in [here](https://github.com/mildannerofc/s1disasm-asm68k-megapcm2)
## Is it going to join SHC?
Only in my decisions, staff has warned me to not upload entry with assets that I can't use in my ROM Hack and I'm still improving on my mistakes. I swear, if I submit one more "Under 500" hack on SHC. They will probably take action or the ROM Hack does not follow quality control after having stolen assets removed and replaced with unique assets that's made using programs.
## Where do you find these assets?
Free assets thread, I ask people permission if I want to use it. If they say that not want their music to be used since it's for unique project, I'll refuse to use and listen to what they were saying.
## How to "rip" assets from other ROM Hacks?
Simply using hexadecimal, save state and compressing it to work on the disassembly (You need to ask people permission if they tolerate it).
