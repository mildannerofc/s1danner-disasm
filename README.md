# Sonidanner - Public Source Code
Sonidanner is a ROM Hack of Sonic the Hedgehog that tends to make different and basic linear level design, abilities, music and palette (Also cool stuff that nobody expect it to be in actual ROM Hack). This ROM Hack is actually lesson for making a ROM Hack with unique stuff like palette, music and the exclusive engine used is Purish Engine that Mildanner did make. People do not call it "Sonic 1 Under 500 successor" or else something bad will happen...

This ROM Hack has a goal to be exactly the same palette change (Simple tile change on Zones) and proving that the palette change from the ROM Hack is better than all of the generic palette change from ROM Hacks, also it takes such inspiration for that classic game and tends to follow all of existing artist colors.

Here are questions related to Purish and Sonidanner
## What in the world is "Purish Engine"?
Mildanner's personal ROM Hacking base that he calls it "engine" that has the additions he like.
## "Sonidanner" is it like SoniNeko?
No, there are no stuff related to SoniNeko since there's no people to help in code. I had to make it in individual and not reach the hacking community.
